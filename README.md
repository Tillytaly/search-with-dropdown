# Search With Dropdown

Search with dropdown allows the user to find results pulled out of a complex database. To extend the possibilities of the component, adding and removing items is also available. Similar solutions to this component can be found on internet websites such as zalando or youtube. Search with dropdown improves user experience, since it's easier to find what one is looking for and also check the availability.
